Are you Maxwell Dare Porter, otherwise known as Barnacle Bill the Sailor?

Are you sure about this?

How sure, in a scale of 1 to 10?

Could you ask someone around you?

Ask them and then tell me if they confirmed this.

Ok, that should be enough. We don’t have much time but we had to be sure. It seems to me your trans-manifold data buffer is pretty small so I’ll provide audiovisual descriptions of your coordinates for the time being. Upload is a bitch so we’ll keep it to small strings for your responses.

First, self-awareness: You are naked, and shivering… like a fetus outside the womb.

Second, environmental-cognizance: Around you there’s an open field at nighttime. Far in the distance you distinguish the shadowline that marks the horizon starts moving.

Suddenly, the ones facing you jump on top of each other and form a pyramid. They don’t stop staring at you while doing this. The top fox asks:

Our king told us your kin has a set of pills that concentrate all desirable edibles. We could provide you with those if you so choose. 

Ok, a bit of background. You live in the cotangent bundle of our manifold. For every point in our space there’s a vector field in yours. Our king used to study how to minimize our actions. And for that he had to go to your world. Our effort to track him down will involve you searching for a set of imprints he must have left in his journeys.  Are you ready for the first one?

Go to the source of all knowledge.  Retrieve the source of all suffering.  It should looks like mountain peeks. Inside search for spherical solutions. Is there any highlights? Type them in.

Good, if our calculations are correct, this means the king was in the search of the fox monopole. Your next destination then should
